                    In September 2016, I began my secondary education journey at Amersham School. During my time there, I completed 12 GCSE qualifications, the most in my year cohort, consisting of 4 optional GCSEs in Year 10 and 8 mandatory GCSEs in Year 11. I was honored to receive the Student of the Term award twice for my outstanding commitment. Additionally, I received an award for Academic Excellence in Computer Science, recognizing my exceptional performance in the subject. <br />
                    <br />
                    Beyond academics, I actively contributed to the Hockey Team, serving as captain and leading our team to victory in our inaugural match against Dr Challonerâ€™s Grammar School. In May 2021, I achieved the Duke of Edinburgh Bronze Award by completing the expedition requirement, which involved three months of volunteering, three months of physical activity, and six months of skill development.
